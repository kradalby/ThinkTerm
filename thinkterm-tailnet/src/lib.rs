//! Joining a tailnet from inside ThinkTerm, without the Tailscale app: a node
//! of Tailscale's own Rust implementation, held by `thinkterm-tailnet`, a
//! program the machine's mux server keeps running for it.
//!
//! The settings file says whether the machine joins; while it does, the mux
//! server keeps `thinkterm-tailnet` running ([`keep_node`]), which holds the
//! node ([`follow`], with the `node` feature) and reports what the node is
//! doing to a file the app and `thinkterm tailnet` read. The node runs in a
//! process of its own so that whatever goes wrong in the library -- a panic
//! that aborts, a loop that spins, memory that grows -- stays out of the
//! process the terminal sessions live in. SSH connections to the tailnet's
//! machines go through the node ([`use_for_ssh`]) from any ThinkTerm process
//! on the machine, the mux server's included: they ask `thinkterm-tailnet`
//! for them on a socket, and need nothing of the library. The node also
//! takes SSH connections from the tailnet to this machine's own sshd when
//! `thinkterm tailnet up --serve-ssh` said to ([`Settings::serve_ssh`]), and
//! nothing else.
